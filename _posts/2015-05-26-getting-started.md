The "master" branch for this project's repository contains the finished code, so I've created a new branch called "sandbox", in which we'll go through incremental steps of developing a packaged Chrome application.

In case you, like me, are relatively new to GIT, I've added a [post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-05-25-git-reference %}) containing references to some git commands that we'll need for this tutorial.

Ok, lets get started now.


1. Go to **chrome://extensions/** and enable "Developer mode" so we can load an unpacked extension.

2. Optional: Install [Chrome Dev Editor](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-dev-editor-develop/pnoffddplpippgcfjdhbmhkofpnaalpg?hl=en). Chrome Dev Editor is an IDE for building Chrome apps, it is relatively bare-bones as far as modern IDEs go but, nonetheless, a great tool for getting started with Chrome apps.

3. Yada yada yada...
