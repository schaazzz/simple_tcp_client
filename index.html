title: A Simple TCP Client
layout: page
---

I created this app with just one purpose: to learn how to create a Chrome app. I needed a simple way to test the custom communication protocol of a TCP server running on a PIC32-based IoT device I was working on. There were, ofcourse, easier ways to do this but they wouldn't have been as much fun :-)

This application also supports sending pre-defined sequences over the network.

I followed the tutorial in this <a href = https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_codelab_intro>Google Code Lab</a> -- <em>BUT</em> -- I found the example code in that code lab a little complex for a complete n00b such as myself, so in case you feel the same way, you might find the <a href = "http://schaazzz.github.io/chrome_todo/">tutorial</a> for my <a href = "https://github.com/schaazzz/chrome_todo/">Chrome ToDo</a> app useful.
