A packaged Chrome app - a simple TCP client - which can be used to test communication with a TCP server.

<br><br>I created this app with just one purpose: to learn how to create a packaged Chrome app. I needed a simple way to test the custom communication protocol of a TCP server running on a PIC32-based IoT device I was working on. There were, ofcourse, easier ways to do this but they wouldn't have been as much fun :-)

<br><br>This application also supports sending pre-defined sequences over the network.
